          the original points are not available or show up too small in the
          key.  fake_filled_circles now calls this function
        - added Grid for simplifying working with a grid of plot

            from sdssidl (from Eli Rykoff)
        rem_dup:
            Return indices of unique values of an array, selecting the one
            (when duplicates exist) with the largest value of flag.  Optionally

        the fitsio package instead:  https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio
        The io module will select fitsio if available, otherwise pyfits.
    esutil/sqlite_util.py:

v0.4.1 (2010-08-18)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New files:
    esutil/include/NumpyRecords.h: A header only class for working
        with record arrays in C++.  (ESS)
    esutil/include/NumpyVoidVector.h: A header only class for
        working with numpy vectors in C++.  Unlike NumpyVector.h,
        which is a template class, the type is determined at
        runtime.
    esutil/algorithm.py: New module to hold algorithms.  Currently
        just playing with sorting algorithms.

Modifications:

    esutil/numpy_util:
        * Improvements to ArrayWriter, which is now used for
          aprint() (ESS)
        * Added random_subset() function.
    esutil/htm/htm.py: cylmatch added (BG)
    esutil/coords.py:  Added shiftlon to shift a longitutde coordinate,
        also shiftra which is an alias for shiftlon.
    esutil/io.py:  write() now supports json.
    esutil/stomp_util.py: in_window() can run map.Contains() as well
        as quadrant checking if radius is set (calls quad_check)
    esutil/plotting.py: Added convenience function bscatter() which
        uses biggles as plotting engine.

Other:
Moved exec_process from misc.py to ostools.py



----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.4.0 (2010-04-23)  Lots of major changes and additions.

Additions:

	pyfitspatch:
		A patched version of pyfits that allows writing binary tables from a
		numpy array with fields, recarray, etc. with a single call.  The io.py
		sub-module uses this for input and output from FITS.  The patches have
		been sent to the pyfits people and when incorporated pyfitspatch will
		be dropped.

	numpy_util.ahelp:
        Print out a formatted description of the input array.   If the array
        has fields, individual descriptions are printed for each field.  This
        is designed to be similar to help, struct, /str in IDL.

	numpy_util.aprint:
        Print fields from the array in columns.

    numpy.randind
        Return nrand random indices, with replacement, in the open
        range [0,nmax)

	misc.colprint():
		Print a set of input sequences or arrays in columns.

	ostools.DirStack: A simple directory stack like that supported by unix
		shells.

	io.write: Support writing files.  Currently only FITS is supported.

Enhancements:
	stat.histogram can now return statistics about the histogram and
		binning of the data.  If getdict=True, a dictionary is returned
		with the 'hist' as well as the lower end of each bin 'low',
		'high', 'center', 'mean', 'median', 'std', 'err'.  If the
		new keyword weights= is sent, the weighted versions are also
		returned as 'wmean', 'wstd', etc.

Rearrangement:
	stat is now a sub-package.  The histogram code has now been written
	as a C++ extension.

	gauleg is not a C++ extension instead of a scipy.weave thing.

Bug Fixes:
	Fix in NumpyVector.h to allow for the fact that int64_t and npy_int64
	actually have different type ids on OS X.  This affected the htm code.

	Re-implemented the histogramming code as a C extension instead of
	using scipy.weave.  This circumvents the bug in weave for gcc >= 4.3.
	Same for gauleg.

-----------------------------------------------
v0.3.0 (2010-04-04)

New files and packages:
	htm package:
		Added C++ code for working with the Heierarchical Triangular Mesh
		(HTM).  This is a code for breaking the sky into spherical triangles, a
		quad tree, which makes for fast searching.  Includes the class HTM with
		methods such as lookup_id for finding the htm id of an ra,dec, match
		for finding matches between lists of ra,dec and bincount for counting
		pairs in radial bins, useful for calculating correlation functions.

	integrate.py:
		Tools for numerical integration.  Currently has a class for performing
		gauss-legendre integration.

	plotting.py:
		Tools for plotting with matplotlib.
			setuplot() for setting up the plotting and establishing a plot
				object.
			set_mino0r_ticks() for setting up minor tick mark locations in
				a smart way.
			whiskers: Plot whiskers, or arrowless vectors.
	random.py:
		Contains a class for generating random points from an arbitrary
		probability distribution.

	coords.py:
		astro_util.py is now coords.py, appropriate since all the code was
		coordinate transformations.

Other Changes:
	Numerous changes that I forgot to write into this release notes. Will be
	more diligent in the future.
